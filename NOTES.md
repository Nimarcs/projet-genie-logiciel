## Thing have learned
- We improved our commit name quality on the way and learned about standard that we will use for next project (see [conventionnalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/))
- When the database is dependent on the business part and not the opposite, or more genrally in a iterative mindset. Starting with the database is a task that we should have started later. Here we would have been stuck updating the database each time we modified something in the business even though we were still only starting working on it. We decided to put the database connection for future iteration when the business part would be more stable
