## Thing have learned
- We improved our commit name quality on the way and learned about standard that we will use for next project (see [conventionnalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/))
- When the database is dependent on the business part and not the opposite, or more genrally in a iterative mindset. Starting with the database is a task that we should have started later. Here we would have been stuck updating the database each time we modified something in the business even though we were still only starting working on it. We decided to put the database connection for future iteration when the business part would be more stable
- When is composed of developer bot used to a language, the quality of the code tend to need even more refactoring than usual

## Notes
Here we changed the length of iteration to have a similar number of hours of work. Fixing the length of the iteration an taking less work depending on the time available was also an option (with the risk of empty iteration)   
   
We tried to install SonarQube and we did have a few test running correctly, but we did not succeed to set an automatic workflow running SonarScanner (Probably because the SonarQube serveur was only hosted in local)
